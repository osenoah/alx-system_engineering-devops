# Shell, init files, variables and expansions

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about alias builtin, help builtin, local, global and reserved variables (PATH, HOME and PS1), special parameters `$?` and single an double quotes in **Shell**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in `Bash`
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

All of the following files are scripts:

| `7-create_global_variable` | Creates a new global variable named `BEST` |
| `8-true_knowledge` | Prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line |
| `9-divide_and_rule` | Prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line |
| `10-love_exponent_breath` | Displays the result of `BREATH` to the power `LOVE` |
| `11-binary_to_decimal` | Converts a number from base 2 to base 10 |
| `12-combinations` | Prints all possible combinations of two letters, except `oo` |
| `13-print_float` | Prints a number with two decimal places. The number is stored in the environment variable `NUM` |
| `14-decimal_to_hexadecimal` | Converts a number from base 10 to base 16 |
| `100-rot13` | Encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption |
| `101-odd` | Prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line |
| `102-water_and_str` | Adds the two numbers stored in the environment variables `WATER` and `STIR` and prints the result |
